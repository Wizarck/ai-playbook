# Changelog

All notable changes to `ai-playbook` are documented here. Semver.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- Initial scaffold: directory tree, metadata, placeholder specs/scripts/tests/templates/docs.
- `baseline` branch capturing the pre-refactor state for rollback safety.
- `AGENTS.md` self-hosted dispatcher (for agents working ON the playbook itself).
- Empty pre-commit config and GitHub workflow stubs (populated in T09 / T17 / T22).

### Notes
- Content for specs (`specs/*.md`), scripts (`scripts/*.py`), and tests (`tests/*.py`) is populated by downstream tracks T02–T23. Stubs carry `TODO: populated in TXX` banners so consumers can grep for gaps.
- No LICENSE file yet. Added in T22 (governance).
